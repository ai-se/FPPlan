\section{Threats to Validity}
\label{sect:threats}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=-1pt]
\item[] \textit{Sampling Bias}: Sampling bias threatens any classification experiment;
what matters in one case may or may not hold in another case. 
For example, data sets in this study come from several sources, but they were all supplied by individuals. Thus, we have documented our selection procedure for data and suggest that researchers
try a broader range of data.
\item[] \textit{Evaluation Bias}:
This paper uses one measure for the quality of the planners
and other quality measures may be used to quantify the effectiveness of planner. A comprehensive analysis using these measures may be performed with our replication package. Additionally, other measures can easily be added to extend this replication package.

\item[] \textit{Order Bias}: 
Theoretically, with prediction tasks involving learners such as random forests, there is invariably some degree of randomness that is introduced by the algorithm. To mitigate these biases, researchers, including ourselves in our other work, report the central tendency and variations over those runs with some statistical test. However, in this case, all our approaches are \textit{deterministic}. Hence, there is no need to repeat the experiments or run statistical tests. Thus, we conclude that while order bias is theoretically a problem, 
it is not a major problem in the particular case of this study.
